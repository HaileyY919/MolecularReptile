        <h1>Spotted Python</h1>
        <h2>Antaresia maculosa</h2>
        <p>This is the largest species in the antaresia genus but with most adults being between 3-4’ in length they are still a very small python. In nature they are mainly found along the east coast of Australia from northern New South Wales through eastern Queensland as well as throughout most of the Cape York peninsula. Not long ago the first spotted python was discovered in the south west corner of the Western province of New Guinea. Later the same python was also found in the South east corner of the papua province Indonesia. The genus once thought to be endemic to only Australia now is known to have at least a small range within New Guinea. Time will tell if it is just a range extension of the spotted python or a new species altogether! As their name suggests these pythons display a bold spotted pattern colored with a black to dark brown on a contrasting light beige background. In domestic collections there is a morph that is readily available called the “Granite” and as its name implies they have a heavily speckled appearance along with some selectively bred ones that are nearly pattern less. Another way less common look is a striped spotted. Specimens with this appearance typically have a thin gold stripe along the spine contained inside a thick jagged black stripe along the back.  Also available is a natural form from the Cape York peninsula which is a very pretty natural variation of the spotted python.</p>
