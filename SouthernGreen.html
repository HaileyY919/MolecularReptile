        <h1>Southern Green Tree Python</h1>
        <h2>Morelia viridis</h2>
        <p>Southern Green Pythons have an average adult size of 3-4 ft. As it common name suggests the southern Green python inhabits areas with suitable habitat of New Guinea south of the central dividing range as well as the Aru Island archipelago. There are also a couple small likely remnant populations found on the Cape York peninsula of Australia. Green Tree pythons are predominantly a bright green colored species with varying amounts of blue, White, and Yellow. The babies of the southern species are all yellow and the adults of this species are typically green with a white stripe along the spine and some blue speckling and blotches as well. The completeness of the white stripe does vary from almost nothing to a complete unspoken stripe. In the Aru race the white stripe is replaced with varying amounts of white speckling. Trade names associated with this species are Aru Islands, Merauke, Tanahmerah, Oksibil, and Iron Range.</p>
        <p>My group of Arus is made up of multiple generation CB from predominantly two main bloodlines. I recently started working with Merauke specimens but have yet to produce this form myself.</p>
