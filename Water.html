        <h1>Water Python</h1>
        <h2>Liasis fuscus</h2>
        <p>This is a medium sized python with adults averaging 4-7’. This python is found in the northern part of Australia’s Kimberley region, throughout the Cape York peninsula, several islands in the Torres Strait, and extending partly down the eastern coast of Queensland. This species also has a very limited range on the extreme southern edge of the Island of New Guinea both in the Indonesian governed side of West papua as well as into the papuan New guinea side of the Island. This pattern less highly iridescent species exhibits an overall coloration that can vary from a deep rich dark chocolate brown nearly almost black appearance to a much lighter brown. The belly is a stunning yellow-gold color that contrasts sharply with the rest of the snake. Recent DNA analysis revealed that this species could actually be two separate species with a western form as well as a eastern form that would also include the New Guinea specimens. You do not see many keepers working with this rare taxon and very few are produced each year.</p>
