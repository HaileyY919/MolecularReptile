        <h1>Wetar Island Python</h1>
        <h2>Liasis dunni</h2>
        <p>This is a medium sized python with adults averaging 4-6 feet in length. The species is endemic to the island of Wetar which is to the north of the island of Timor. Wetar is part of the Barat Daya Islands found in the extreme southwest portion of the larger Maluku Islands. This taxon is extremely rare in captivity and unlike its close relative the savu python, it received very little fanfare when it first came into the trade in the mid to late 90s. Although they are often confused with the Macklotâ€™s python, they are truly quite distinct. Wetar pythons are likely the most naturally variable of all the liasis species. Adults can range from patternless beige or silver to speckled individuals in the same base colors with patternless neck, chin, and bellies typically white in color. A trait unique to dunni within the liasis genus is the babies can hatch out to be either reddish brown or a silver grey color. </p>
