        <h1>Southern White Lip Python</h1>
        <h2>Leiopython meridionalis</h2>
        <p>This medium sized python has an average adult length of 5-8â€™. This python comes from the lowland areas on the Southern half of the Island of New Guinea. There are also notes suggesting this species also inhabits some islands in the Torres Strait. This stunningly iridescent pattern less species is mostly all black with some specimens displaying a lighter silver-Blue color but the head remains Black. The stark white scales along the lip contrast greatly with the dark black face and also give the snake its common name. I find these to be one of the most stunning pythons in the hobby. They are usually much more tractable than the Gold species as well as being quite a bit more robust. Very few keepers peed this challenging species and more work needs to be done to get more CB specimens consistently available to python enthusiasts. </p>
