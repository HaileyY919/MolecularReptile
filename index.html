    <!-- <p>Welcome to Molecular Reptile, this website showcases the many years of hard work in selecting and producing some of the most amazing examples of the species I keep, whether it be a natural form or morph. I am especially drawn to the pythons from Australia and Indonesia and currently keep one of the most diverse collections of pythons in the country. I am extremely interested in the history of our captive bloodlines and take great pride in maintaining unique and pure examples of many of the species I work with.</p>
    <p>Along with the Indo Australian species, Molecular Reptile has also spent a great deal of time and effort producing some of the most visually stunning and rarely seen Ball and Blood python combinations available anywhere. My primary focus is with multiple recessive combinations, always striving to take my projects to the next level. With a focus on combinations that work well together, not just simply adding as many genes as possible with no sense of direction that is commonly seen in this industry.</p>
    <p>I hope you enjoy the pictures and information available on this site. And look forward to providing the best possible customer service along with animals of the highest quality, even for the most discerning of customers.</p> -->
