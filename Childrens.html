        <h2>Antaresia childreni</h2>
        <p>This is a small species of python with most adults averaging less than 3â€™ in length. In nature they are found in much of the northern portion of Australia from the Kimberley to north eastern Queensland as well as on several islands in the Gulf of Carpentaria. They are a very softly patterned to pattern less species with adults displaying mostly soft earth tones. The color and pattern of this species does vary widely throughout its range with some populations being very unique in build, color, and pattern. Anyone from the novice to the advanced keeper will find this species very rewarding to work with.</p>
