        <h1>Woma Python</h1>
        <h2>Aspidites ramsayi</h2>
        <p>This small to medium sized python averages 3-5’ as an adult over most of its range with an exception being that the southeastern form can grow to over 8’. This snake is found throughout much of the arid central portions of Australia from the west coast of West Australia, through the southern portion of the Northern Territory, the northern portion of South Australia, southwestern Queensland, and northwestern New South Wales. Another population was found in southwestern West Australia but the species may no longer be present in that region. The look of this species varies considerably throughout its range but overall it has a banded appearance with base colors of light brown to cream with bands of that can range from deep orange-red to dark brown. The head is a pattern less orange to yellow with most specimens showing varying amounts of black over the eyes as well as possibly over the top of the head. bright colors and ease of keeping makes this species one of the finest captives any keeper could ask for.</p>
